What are the best tools to improve your development productivity and build better Android apps? I've been using these tools for a while, and they have helped me and my team save a lot of precious time and deliver higher-quality apps.

Here are the tools that have earned a place in my developer's toolbox. Start here and you'll be well on your way to developing Android apps like a pro.

* **FlowUp**

This amazing tool helps you track the overall performance of your production apps, with in-depth insights on key performance metrics such as FPS, memory usage, CPU usage, disk usage, and more. FlowUp is priced based on number of users.

* **JRebel for Android**

We all get quite frustrated staring at the screen like a fool and waiting for Gradle builds that take forever to finish. But this awesome tool from JRebel comes to the rescue by drastically improving build times and making Android app development and debugging almost real time.

* **Gradle, Please**

If you are using Gradle as your build system in Android Studio, then you can add any external library in your project with just a single line of code. But how do you get that line quickly and easily? That's where this sweet little website comes in handy. Visit the site and you'll be able to quickly find the line of code for the library you want to use.
