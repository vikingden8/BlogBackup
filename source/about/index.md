Hello, I am Viking, this is my web site about study technical stuff and anything else I find time to write about. I currently work as an Android test-developer base in ShenZhen.    

Recently I put emphasis on Java, Android, Python and Web.    

Oh, BTW, I am a father some days ago.  

If you want to chat, don't hesitate to contact me from the section below. Thanks!
